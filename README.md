### Predicting-Term-Deposit-Subscriptions-in-Portuguese-Banking

In the initial project phase, I conducted robust data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, using various plots to understand feature-subscription correlations. To address dataset imbalance, I applied SMOTE, ensuring a more balanced representation.

Following this, I trained machine learning algorithms. Logistic Regression and SVM achieved strong training accuracies without overfitting. Despite initial overfitting, I optimized the Decision Tree model through Regularization, achieving 82.6% accuracy.

Ensemble models like XGBoost and Gradient Boosting were explored, alongside implementing Random Forest to handle dataset complexity. Though initially overfitting, an exhaustive hyperparameter tuning process, including Grid Search, fine-tuned the Random Forest for enhanced generalization.

The final model, after training on both training and validation sets, outperformed others on test data. Notably, the fine-tuned Random Forest showcased the project's success in optimizing model performance.
